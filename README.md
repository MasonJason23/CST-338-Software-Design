# CST-338-Software-Design
CST 338 Software Design coursework via IntelliJ IDEA & Android Studio. In this course, I learned object-oriented programming via Java and the basics of developing applications on android.

Note* The code shown in this repository were created by Jason Casareno via IntelliJ IDEA & Android Studio. This meaning that some of the code cannot run on their own as they require other files/software in order to work.

**Code via IntelliJ IDEA:** Homework 2-4, Lab02-06, Project 1
**Code via Android Studio:** Celsius to Fahrenheit, Five Buttons
